# SentdexML
Code and notes from Sentdex's "Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python" series. 

I'm working through this 72-part series that Sentdex(Harrison) put out back in 2016. So far, there have been a few changes and corrections due to typos or deprecated components. I figured that creating this might help other learners as they went through the lessons. 

##Link to the course is here:

Feedback, comments, and corrections are welcome!
